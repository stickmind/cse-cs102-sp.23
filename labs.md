Course Lab is a chance to collaboratively experiment and explore, ask and answer questions, and get hands-on practice in a supported environment.

You will work on a set of lab exercises that revisit topics from recent lectures/readings. We are all working together to advance our knowledge of the material! Use the time to further practice your skills, help others, ask questions, and explore.

We have also designed labs specifically to prepare you for assignments - the more you put into exploring problems and concepts during labs, the more it will pay off when you start the next assignment!

To track lab participation, we have an online checkoff form for you to fill out as you work. Lab is not a race to find answers to exactly and only the checkoff questions.

For lab each week, we plan to mine our favorite open-source projects ([musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/){:target="_blank"}, [BusyBox unix utilities](https://busybox.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Apple](https://opensource.apple.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Google](https://opensource.google.com/){:target="_blank"} and more) for interesting systems code to use as an object of study. We use this code to learn how various programming techniques are used in context, give insight into industry best practices, and provide opportunities for reflection and critique.

We will have some noteworthy code picked out for you to explore in each lab.
